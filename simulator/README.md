# Simulator

## Description

To have a better visualization of our system's regulation,
we developed a simulator that generate a `.csv` file by taking
the following parameters:

- `nbCommunity`: Number of communities.
- `nbHouseByCommunity`: Number of customers by community.
- `averageDayConsumptionByCommunity`: Average consumption (in Wh) per community during the day.
- `averageNightConsumptionByCommunity`: Average consumption (in Wh) per community during the night.
- `startingProd`: Initial production.
- `startingHour`: Hour when simulation starts.
- `endingHour`: Hour when simulation ends.

## Run

- Run the simulator:

```bash
./run-simulator.sh
```
